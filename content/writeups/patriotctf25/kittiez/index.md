## Walkthrough

We are provided with a text file that says:

```
I lost it all in one bad tick—
my feline Vault, gone *way* too quick.
A virus on my janky ’puter
went boom and turned my cats to neuter.

I had so many cats in store,
but one’s the one my heart longs for.
If I could see that pic again,
my nine lives might come back to ten.

For “maximum security” flair,
I hashed each cat with loving care.
Couldn’t back up the pics themselves—
the feds would sniff them off my shelves.

So now I search through bits and trash
for just one sacred, purring stash.
If you can find that photo, friend,
my broken heart might almost mend. <3

The md5 file hash of my beloved picture is:

9c5ca692da8d6e489beecd5b448ddb35

(  The flag is the text in the image - case insensitive. Replace spaces with underscores, i.e. pctf{I_Love_Kitties!}  )

```

The point of the challenge was to come across `https://vx-underground.org/Archive/Cat%20Picture%20Collection` and to download each zip file of the cat pics and get hashing to find `9c5ca692da8d6e489beecd5b448ddb35`.

Kinda a guessy challenge because if you are not in the cybersecurity community for a longer time you would not know this website exists and had to end up there somehow.

Anyways here is the picture, the flag is the text on the image. 🐱
